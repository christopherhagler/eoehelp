# EoE Elimination Diet App

## Overview

The EoE Elimination Diet App aims to help individuals diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) manage their symptoms through an elimination diet. The app provides a way to track meals, ingredients, allergy symptoms, medications, and endoscopic procedures. Users can also choose to contribute their data for research purposes, helping to advance our understanding of EoE.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management.
- **Meal Tracking**: Log your meals along with the ingredients and associate them with any observed allergy symptoms.
- **Symptom Tracking**: Record allergy symptoms, their severity, and when they occurred.
- **Medication Tracking**: Keep track of current medications, doses, and manufacturers.
- **Endoscopic Procedure Tracking**: Record endoscopy dates, times, and eosinophil counts.
- **Data for Research**: Users can opt to allow their data to be used for research purposes.
